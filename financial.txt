i am applying  for financial aid because of these reasons i mention below
1)i am full time university student,i spend most of my time studying i don't have time  for work and also their is no work available around
me even if i have time left from studying and my homework assignments,projects and tests;therefore i cannot afford to pay for this course.
2)My parents are poor they have many children to feed that cannot help me pay.
3) i live in Ethiopia Ethiopia does not allow to send money outside Ethiopia and also paypal and other international payment systems do not work in Ethiopia.
4)i don't have any relative abroad that can help me pay me.
5) my freinds are also like me they do not  afford  to lend me and they does not have any relatives outside Ethiopia 
to help me pay even that can help me create international bank account.
